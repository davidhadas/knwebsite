  title: Secure your services
  description: >
      Knative helps you keep your service secured. 
      By securing your communication using TLS; 
      By alerting you when your service is attacked or is compromised (when using security-guard); 
      By helping you avoid configurtion drift as it automates most of the Kubernets service setup.
